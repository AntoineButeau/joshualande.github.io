title: Learn SQL With Simple Examples
comments: true
---

In this series of posts, I will 
I will go over many of the benefits of relational
databases like [SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) and describe
the ways in which they are better than other programming languages
and data formats. 

Then, by way of a simple to understand example, I will describe the
basics of how to store data in a database and the benefits of
database normalization.  Using this example, I will work
through successively harder SQL queries to introduce the basic
operators in SQL like filtering, joining and aggregating.

This post is intended as more of a why than a how.  Despite 
lacking throughness, by the end of the post you 
should dave a good overview of the key benefits and major topics
of SQL. In this post, I will show commands for the 
[MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) database, but the commands and 
concepts are easily transferable to other databases.
