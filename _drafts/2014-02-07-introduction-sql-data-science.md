title: What Every Data Scientist Needs to Know about SQL
comments: true
---

One of the most important tools required to be a successful data
scientist are relational databases like
[SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL).  The large majority of
data stored by businesses is stored in these relational databases,
so it is key to understand the the benefits and limitiations of
these.

In this series of posts, I will provide a broad overview of the key
topics required to successfuly work with databases to do effective
data science. My hope is to take a breath-first search approach
to teaching, getting you up to speed as quickly as possible.

<!--
This post is intended as more of a why than a how.  Despite 
lacking throughness, by the end of the post you 
should dave a good overview of the key benefits and major topics
of SQL. In this post, I will show commands for the 
[MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) database, but the commands and 
concepts are easily transferable to other databases.

The posts are:

1. **"Design a Better Database With Database Normalization"**

   In this post, we will go over the benefits of relational databases
   like SQL and describe the ways in which they are better than
   other programming languages and data formats.

   By way of a simple example, we will go over 
   basics database normalization, which is the best-practice for correctly
   storing complex data in a database.


2. **"How to Query in SQL With the SELECT Statement"**

   In this post, we will go over the basics of quering data from a
   database. Using the example from above, I will work through
   successively harder queries show how the simple operatorions can
   be used to ask complicated questions.

3. **"Indexing in SQL for the Rest of Us"**

4. **"How to Handle Missing Data in SQL Using NULL Values"**
