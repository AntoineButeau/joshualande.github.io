title: Moving from Wordpress to Jekyll + Github Pages

I recently migrated this website from [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com) to [Github pages](http://pages.github.com/), and I am really happy with the trnasition. Over time, I grew to really dislike how heavy-weight Wordpress is. I've never liked how when you write HTML in a WYSIWYG editor you aren't sure what code it is creating. The process of backing up my blog was a huge pain. And whenever I went in to edit anything, I was always afraid that I would fat-finger change somthing withotu realizing it. I hated having to mantain a opaque database in order to keep all of my text. And I was never sure how to dive into the HTML if I wanted to customize anything.

So when I learned about Jekyll, it seemed like a really great alternative. I could write my posts in standard markdown syntax 

Make a note about how I used GitHub Pages.
