# Useful References

Below are some useful references that helped me prepare to interview for jobs as a data scientist:

SQL/Database Preperation:

* Check out the section "Relational Databases, Relational Algebra" of this course for a discussion of why SQL databases are so great in practice: https://class.coursera.org/datasci-001/lecture/preview


Machine Learning Preperation:

* Andrew Ng's coursera machine learning class ([link](https://class.coursera.org/ml-003/lecture/preview)). Note, you can watch the lectures without offically taking the class if it is not offered or you have limited time.


To help learn CS fundamentals and prepare for the technical coding interview:

* 2 books to prepare for technical interviews:
  * Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions ([Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X))
  * Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job ([Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Secrets-Programmer/dp/047012167X))
* The Stanford Algorithms lecures on Coursera are very good: [part1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo) and [part2](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2). Note, you can watch the lectures without offically taking the class through the preview link.
