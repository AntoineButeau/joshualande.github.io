title: "SStoRM: the Solar Storm Radiation Model"
---

During the summers of 2004 and 2005, I participated in a
[SEAP](http://seap.asee.org/program_details) internship at
[ANSER](http://www.anser.org). During the internships, I wrote [SStoRM:
the Solar Storm Radiation Model](http://joshualande.github.com/SStoRM).
SStoRM is a graphical computer program written in Java which can
be used to simulate [solar particle
events](http://srag-nt.jsc.nasa.gov/SpaceRadiation/What/What.cfm)
and asses the damage they could cause to astronauts. I have written
about the internship
[here](http://joshualande.com/academics/marlboro-college/seap-internship/). SStoRM
is open source and is hosted on
[github](http://joshualande.github.com/SStoRM).
