title: The Area Diffraction Machine
---

In college, I participated in a [SULI
internship](http://www-group.slac.stanford.edu/aao/suli.asp) at
[SLAC](http://www.slac.stanford.edu). During the internship, I wrote
a computer program called the  [Area Diffraction
Machine](http://code.google.com/p/areadiffractionmachine) for
calibrating [X-ray powder
diffraction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_diffraction) data.
I have written about the internship
[here](http://joshualande.com/academics/marlboro-college/slac-suli-internship).
The program is open source and is hosted on [Google
Code](http://code.google.com/p/areadiffractionmachine).
